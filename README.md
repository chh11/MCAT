MCAT++: Multi-scale Change-Aware Transformer with Edge-aware Adaptive Contrastive Loss for Complex Change Detection

Mining Area Change Detection (MACD) Dataset
--
Our MACD dataset is the first dataset specifically designed for change detection in mining areas. The dataset consists of $2553$ pairs of temporal images, divided into a training set of $2014$ image pairs and a test set of $539$ image pairs, each with a resolution of $128 \times 128$ pixels. Unlike existing datasets for urban construction and land cover monitoring, the MACD dataset captures a wide range of scale variations and complex change patterns, making it particularly suitable for improving the robustness of change detection algorithms in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the MACD dataset provides precise segmentation annotations across multiple time periods, enabling accurate identification and analysis of changes.
